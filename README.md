# 🏗 Scaffold-Eth Typescript

## Typescript

This is the typescript repo of scaffold.eth. The directories that you'll use are:

```bash
packages/vite-app-ts/
packages/hardhat-ts/
```

## Quick Start

Running the app

1. install your dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. start a hardhat node

   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

3. run the app, `you'll need to open a new command prompt`

   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   yarn start
   ```

## Overview

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Building on scaffold-eth-typescript

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
yarn compile
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
