# 🏗 Scaffold-Eth Typescript

## Typescript

This is the typescript repo of scaffold-eth and it uses `hardhat` and `vite` to run scaffold-eth-typescript. There is also a nextjs version. The directories that you'll use are:

```bash
packages/vite-app-ts/
packages/hardhat-ts/
packages/next-app-ts/
```

## Quick Start

### Commands to run the app

Running the app

1. install your dependencies, `open a new command prompt`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. start a hardhat node

   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

3. run the app, `open a new command prompt`

   ```bash
   # build hardhat & external contracts types
   yarn contracts:build
   # deploy your hardhat contracts
   yarn deploy
   # start the app (vite)
   yarn start
   ```

4. If you'd like to run the nextjs app, `open a new command prompt`

   ```bash
   # start nextjs app
   yarn start:nextjs

   ```

5. other commands

   ```bash
   # rebuild all contracts, incase of inconsistent state
   yarn contracts:rebuild
   # run hardhat commands for the workspace, or see all tasks
   yarn hardhat 'xxx'
   # get eth for testing locally
   yarn hardhat faucet xxx
   # run any subgraph commands for the workspace
   yarn subgraph 'xxx'
   ```

   Other folders

   ```bash
   # for subgraph
   packages/advanced/subgraph/
   packages/advanced/services/
   ```

### Environment Variables

Vite and NextJs app folders have `.env` files. To create local variables that overrride these, create a file called `.env.local`, or `.env.development.local` or `.env.production.local` and put your overrides in there.

You can set your `TARGET_NETWORK` with them.

## Overview

Everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

- 🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat-ts/contracts`
- 📝 Edit your frontend `MainPage.tsx` in `packages/vite-app-ts/src`
- 💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat-ts/deploy`
- 📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app
- 👷🏽‍♂️ run `yarn hardhat` to get a list of all the tasks. Run `yarn hardhat taskname` to run the task.

## 🔐 P.S.About keys

You need an RPC and API keys for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/vite-app-ts/.env` or `packages/next-app-ts/.env` with your new keys.
